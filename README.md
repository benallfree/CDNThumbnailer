# CDNThumbnailer

This is a fork of `shulard/cdn-thumbnailer` with `benallfree/makenv` environment support for configuration.

CDNThumbnailer is a PHP tool for dynamic image resizing. It has a fast and accurate caching subsystem and so can be used redily with CDNs.

This tool is written in **PHP 5.2** to maximize compatibility (but in a **PHP 5.3** style).

# Installation

```
"require": {
  "benallfree/cdn-thumbnailer": "1.0.*@dev"
}
```

# Configuration

## .htaccess rewrite

Add an image proxy rewrite rule to your `.htaccess` file as follows:

```
RewriteRule ^([0-9]+x[0-9]+)\/(.*)$ vendor/benallfree/cdn-thumbnailer/index.php?path=$2&format=$1 [L]
```

A full example for WordPress:

```
# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !sblogin
RewriteRule ^([0-9]+x[0-9]+)\/(.*)$ vendor/benallfree/cdn-thumbnailer/index.php?path=$2&format=$1 [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php
</IfModule>
# END WordPress
```

## Cache folder

CDNThumbnailer needs to know the absolute path to the cach folder it will be using.

In `makenv`, add a `CDNThumbnailer'. If your folder is named `cache` in the web root, then your `makenv` section would look like this:

```
$config = array(
  'CDNThumbnailer'=>array(
    'cache_path'=>__DIR__.'/cache'
  ),
);
```

Make sure the folder as write permissions.

That's it! You're done.

# Usage

To use CDNThumbnailer, simply prefix any image URL with `WxH` as follows:

Original URL:

`http://mysite.com/my/image/path.jpg`

Becomes:

`http://mysite.com/320x200/my/image/path.jpg`

## Security

For added security, you may want to customize the `.htaccess` rewirte rules to allow only images of predefined sizes. CDNThumbnailer will happily resize to
any dimension supplied.
